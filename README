  # About

This is a Linux module/driver for USB to Serial converter built using
Renesas μPD78F0730 microcontroller.

This converter can be found on YRPBRL78G14 board and other development boards
produced by NEC Electronics and Renesas Electronics. Using this driver you can
program the board mentioned above with rl78flash, or communicate with main MCU
through serial port with any terminal program you like.

The driver is part of the Linux kernel since v4.11.

  # Build

make

  # Install

sudo make install

You can verify that driver is registed by examining modules.alias file
cat /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/modules.alias | grep upd78f0730

  # YRPBRL78G14 notes

Board can be used in 2 modes (selectable by jumpers CN6, CN7, CN8 and CN11):
* OCD/programming (converter is connected to pin TOOL0 through one wire in
  half duplex mode, RTS is connected to RESET)
* Virtual UART (converter is connected to UART0 in full duplex mode,
  RESET is not connected)

Example: get information about target microcontroller (in OCD mode)
rl78flash -inm3 /dev/ttyUSB0
